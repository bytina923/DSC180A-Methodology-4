**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

I think one of the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is **identifying operational inefficiencies through exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the SDG&E CLICK system. I found it fascinating to see how data on task durations, assignments, and regional performance can uncover productivity gaps and scheduling bottlenecks that directly affect workforce efficiency.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate **predictive modeling of crew task duration** using machine learning. By combining features such as task type, assigned engineer, priority level, factor affect delay. and time of day, I plan to build a regression model that predicts expected completion time and helps improve scheduling accuracy and resource allocation.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

One potential change I would make is to **integrate more advanced feature engineering and cross-validation** into the analysis process. 

---

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

I’m interested in exploring **clustering and time-series analysis** to better understand performance trends. Clustering could help group crews or districts with similar operational patterns, while time-series models could detect seasonal variations or recurring inefficiencies in SDG&E’s workflow over time.
